# SQLite Database

SQLite is a lightweight disk-based database that doesn’t require a separate server process and allows accessing the database directly via a file on disk. It’s a great choice for small to medium-sized applications, especially those with limited resources.

**The database is created with the create_database.py**


## SQLite Database Setup
The setup of the database is defined in  [schema.sql](schema.sql)
An Overview is also displayed in the database_design.drawio.
